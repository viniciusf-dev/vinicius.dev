### Introduction
Hello, traveller! Here I'll share my personal tech curiosities. Projects and even articles that I can end up writting about something. Please, feel free to reach me out and talk about some stuff.  

### Who am I?
My name is Vin√≠cius, I'm from Brazil and 23 years old. Currently working remote for Compass UOL. I'm building AI solutions on AWS utilizing different cloud services like DynamoDB, Amazon S3, Api Gateway, Lambda Functions, Step Functions, Amazon SQS, Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Textract & Amazon Polly.

I really enjoy to design software architectures, build APIs, modelling databases and also to apply multithreading and parallelism at processes that can be much faster.

At my work, I've already built AI chatbots, complex data document extractors, AI fluency analyzer agents, wrote SSML for natural human-sounding voices and much more.
